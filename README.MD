# Hello!

## Why did I do this project?
This is the second super duper tiny practice project I did while doing the The Odin Project | NodeJS Course, this time rewriting the basic NodeJS site using Express.


## What have I learned doing this project?
Express makes your life MUCH easier. The process for starting a server and routing was infinitesmally easier than without using Express.


## What would I like to learn after this project?
How to make more complicated websites using Express, and how to structure them well.
